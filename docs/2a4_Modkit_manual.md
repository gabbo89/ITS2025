# Modkit

A bioinformatics tool for working with modified bases from Oxford Nanopore. Specifically for converting modBAM
to bedMethyl files using best practices, but also manipulating modBAM files and generating summary statistics.
Detailed documentation and quick-start can be found in the [online documentation](https://nanoporetech.github.io/modkit/).

## Installation

Pre-compiled binaries are provided for Linux from the [release page](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit/releases). We recommend the use of these in most circumstances.

## Usage

Modkit comprises a suite of tools for manipulating modified-base data stored in [BAM](http://www.htslib.org/) files. Modified base information is stored in the `MM` and `ML` tags (see section 1.7 of the [SAM tags](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf) specification). These tags are produced by contemporary basecallers of data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platforms.

### Constructing bedMethyl tables

A primary use of `modkit` is to create summary counts of modified and unmodified bases in an extended [bedMethyl](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/wgbs/) format. bedMethyl files tabulate the counts of base modifications from every sequencing read over each reference genomic position.

In its simplest form `modkit` creates a bedMethyl file using the following:

```bash
modkit pileup path/to/reads.bam output/path/pileup.bed --log-filepath pileup.log
```

No reference sequence is required. A single file (described [below](#description-of-bedmethyl-output)) with base count summaries will be created. The final argument here specifies an optional log file output.

The program performs best-practices filtering and manipulation of the raw data stored in the input file. For further details see [filtering modified-base calls](./book/src/filtering.md).

## Description of bedMethyl output

Below is a description of the bedMethyl columns generated by `modkit pileup`. A brief description of the
bedMethyl specification can be found on [Encode](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/wgbs/).

### Definitions:

* N<sub>mod</sub> - Number of calls passing filters that were classified as a residue with a specified base modification.
* N<sub>canonical</sub> - Number of calls passing filters were classified as the canonical base rather than modified. The
exact base must be inferred by the modification code. For example, if the modification code is `m` (5mC) then
the canonical base is cytosine. If the modification code is `a`, the canonical base is adenosine.
* N<sub>other mod</sub> - Number of calls passing filters that were classified as modified, but where the modification is different from the listed base (and the corresponding canonical base is equal). For example, for a given cytosine there may be 3 reads with
`h` calls, 1 with a canonical call, and 2 with `m` calls. In the bedMethyl row for `h` N<sub>other_mod</sub> would be 2. In the
`m` row N<sub>other_mod</sub> would be 3.
* N<sub>valid_cov</sub> - the valid coverage. N<sub>valid_cov</sub> = N<sub>mod</sub> + N<sub>other_mod</sub> + N<sub>canonical</sub>, also used as the `score` in the bedMethyl
* N<sub>diff</sub> - Number of reads with a base other than the canonical base for this modification. For example, in a row
for `h` the canonical base is cytosine, if there are 2 reads with C->A substitutions, N<sub>diff</sub> will be 2.
* N<sub>delete</sub> - Number of reads with a deletion at this reference position
* N<sub>fail</sub> - Number of calls where the probability of the call was below the threshold. The threshold can be
set on the command line or computed from the data (usually failing the lowest 10th percentile of calls).
* N<sub>nocall</sub> - Number of reads aligned to this reference position, with the correct canonical base, but without a base
modification call. This can happen, for example, if the model requires a CpG dinucleotide and the read has a
CG->CH substitution such that no modification call was produced by the basecaller.
