# Trim Galore
_Trim Galore_ is a wrapper around [Cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt) and [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to consistently apply adapter and quality trimming to FastQ files, with extra functionality for RRBS data.

## Documentation
For a detail manual see the [User manual](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md)

## the relevant informations are the following:
### Step 1: Quality Trimming
In the first step, low-quality base calls are trimmed off from the 3' end of the reads before adapter removal. This efficiently removes poor quality portions of the reads.

### Step 2: Adapter Trimming
In the next step, Cutadapt finds and removes adapter sequences from the 3â€™ end of reads. 

#### Adapter auto-detection
If no sequence was supplied, Trim Galore will attempt to auto-detect the adapter which has been used. For this it will analyse the first 1 million sequences of the first specified file and attempt to find the first 12 or 13bp of the following standard adapters:

```
Illumina:   AGATCGGAAGAGC
Small RNA:  TGGAATTCTCGG
Nextera:    CTGTCTCTTATA
```

If no adapter contamination can be detected within the first 1 million sequences, or in case of a tie between several different adapters, Trim Galore defaults to `--illumina`, as long as the Illumina adapter sequence was one of the options. If there was a tie between the Nextera and small RNA adapter, the default is `--nextera`. The auto-detection results are shown on screen and printed to the trimming report for future reference.

### Step 3: Removing Short Sequences
Lastly, since quality and/or adapter trimming may result in very short sequences (sometimes as short as 0 bp), Trim Galore! can filter trimmed reads based on their sequence length (default: 20 bp). This is to reduce the size of the output file and to avoid crashes of alignment programs which require sequences with a certain minimum length.

#### Paired-End Data
Note that it is not recommended to remove too-short sequences if the analysed FastQ file is one of a pair of paired-end files, since this confuses the sequence-by-sequence order of paired-end reads which is again required by many aligners. For paired-end files, Trim Galore! has an option `--paired` which runs a paired-end validation on both trimmed `_1` and `_2` FastQ files once the trimming has completed. This step removes entire read pairs if at least one of the two sequences became shorter than a certain threshold. If only one of the two reads is longer than the set threshold, e.g. when one read has very poor qualities throughout, this singleton read can be written out to unpaired files (see option `retain_unpaired`) which may be aligned in a single-end manner.
